SAMPLEBUILDER.JAVA DOCUMENTATION
=================================

PURPOSE:
Eclipse incremental project builder that validates XML files in Rebeca projects. Currently focused on XML validation rather than Rebeca compilation.

ECLIPSE VS AFRA:
- Extends Eclipse IncrementalProjectBuilder
- Generic XML validation functionality (not Rebeca-specific)

KEY METHODS:
- build(int, Map, IProgressMonitor): Main build method, handles full and incremental builds
- checkXML(IResource): Validates XML files using SAX parser
- addMarker(): Creates error markers for XML validation issues
- clean(IProgressMonitor): Removes all markers during clean build

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Currently validates XML files, not Rebeca files
- Uses SAX parser for XML validation
- Creates Eclipse markers for XML parsing errors
- Part of the build system but not the main Rebeca compiler
- The actual Rebeca compilation happens in CompilationAndCodeGenerationProcess
