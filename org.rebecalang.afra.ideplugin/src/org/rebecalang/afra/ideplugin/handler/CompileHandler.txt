COMPILEHANDLER.JAVA DOCUMENTATION
==================================

PURPOSE:
Eclipse command handler that manages compilation of Rebeca models. Triggered when user clicks compile button/menu.

ECLIPSE VS AFRA:
- Uses Eclipse E4 dependency injection (@Execute, @CanExecute)
- Afra-specific implementation for Rebeca compilation workflow

KEY METHODS:
- canExecute(EPartService): Determines if compilation can be executed (validates active file)
- execute(Shell): Main compilation execution, delegates to CompilationAndCodeGenerationProcess
- Handles different compilation statuses (SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, CANCELED, RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This is the entry point for user-triggered compilation
- Shows compilation results in message dialogs
- Opens Problems View on compilation failures
- Validates that active file is a valid Rebeca file before compiling
- Essential for the compile workflow in the IDE
