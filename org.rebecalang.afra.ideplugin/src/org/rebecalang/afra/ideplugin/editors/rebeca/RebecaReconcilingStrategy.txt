REBECARECONCILINGSTRATEGY.JAVA DOCUMENTATION
============================================

PURPOSE:
Handles real-time analysis of Rebeca code for code folding. Runs as user types to identify foldable regions.

ECLIPSE VS AFRA:
- Implements Eclipse IReconcilingStrategy interface
- Afra-specific implementation for Rebeca code structure analysis

KEY METHODS:
- reconcile(): Triggered when document changes, calls initialReconcile()
- initialReconcile(): Starts the reconciliation process
- calculatePositions(): Analyzes document to find foldable code blocks
- getTokens(): Scans document for opening/closing braces to identify code blocks
- emitPosition(int, int): Adds a foldable position to the list

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Provides code folding by detecting matching braces { }
- Runs asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI
- Updates editor folding structure in real-time
- Simple brace-matching algorithm for code folding
- Essential for code organization and readability features
