Real-Time Syntax Checking Feature - Implementation Summary
============================================================

FEATURE OVERVIEW:
Implemented real-time syntax checking for Rebeca IDE with 300ms debouncing that shows syntax errors as users type, similar to modern IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ.

‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:

üìÅ FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:

1. **RealTimeSyntaxChecker.java** (NEW)
   - Core real-time syntax checking engine
   - Implements IDocumentListener for document change detection
   - Uses Spring DI to access compiler components
   - Performs debounced syntax checking with 300ms delay
   - Creates Eclipse error markers for syntax errors

2. **RebecaEditor.java** (MODIFIED)
   - Added RealTimeSyntaxChecker integration
   - Initialization in createPartControl()
   - Proper lifecycle management in dispose()
   - Public accessor methods for syntax checker access

3. **Documentation Files** (NEW)
   - RealTimeSyntaxChecker.txt: Technical documentation
   - RealTimeSyntaxFeature.txt: Implementation summary

üîß TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:

**Debouncing System:**
- 300ms delay after last document change
- Timer-based implementation with cancellation
- Prevents excessive checking during rapid typing
- Balances responsiveness with performance

**Compiler Integration:**
- Uses same Spring context as main compiler (RMCConfig, CompilerConfig)
- Same ModelCheckersFilesGenerator and ExceptionContainer
- Same extension detection (Core, Timed, Probabilistic Rebeca)
- Same FileGeneratorProperties creation logic
- Compatible with all project types and language versions

**Performance Optimizations:**
1. **Syntax-only checking**: No C++ file generation
2. **Fast-fail**: Stops at first error for speed
3. **Temporary files**: Isolated compilation environment
4. **Minimal properties**: Skip safe mode, progress reporting
5. **Concurrent prevention**: Only one check at a time
6. **Smart cleanup**: Efficient temp file/directory management

**Error Marker System:**
- Creates IMarker.PROBLEM with SEVERITY_ERROR
- Uses same CodeCompilationException as full compiler
- Tags markers with "syntaxChecker" = "realTime"
- Shows as red X in editor margin
- Displays error message on hover
- Only shows first error (performance optimization)

üéØ USER EXPERIENCE:

**Real-Time Feedback:**
- Immediate syntax error detection
- Non-intrusive 300ms delay
- Visual indicators (red X markers)
- Error messages on hover
- Works while typing without blocking UI

**Smart Marker Management:**
- Preserves full compilation markers
- Only removes real-time syntax markers
- Auto-clears when errors are fixed
- Doesn't interfere with other editor features

**Seamless Integration:**
- Works with existing auto-completion
- Compatible with hover tooltips
- Works with code formatting
- Integrates with Problems View

üìà PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:

**Speed Optimizations:**
- Syntax parsing only (no code generation)
- Fast-fail on first error
- Minimal compiler configuration
- Efficient temporary file handling
- Smart debouncing prevents excessive work

**Memory Management:**
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files/directories
- Proper disposal in editor lifecycle
- Timer cancellation prevents memory leaks
- Concurrent check prevention

**Responsiveness:**
- 300ms delay feels instant to users
- Non-blocking UI operations
- Background processing with UI thread for markers
- Cancellable operations during rapid typing

üîÑ WORKFLOW:

**User Workflow:**
1. User opens .rebeca file in editor
2. Real-time syntax checker automatically starts
3. User types/edits code
4. After 300ms of no changes, syntax check runs
5. Red X appears if syntax error found
6. Error message shows on hover
7. Error disappears when fixed
8. Process continues throughout editing session

**Technical Workflow:**
1. documentChanged() detects user input
2. Previous timer cancelled, new 300ms timer started
3. performSyntaxCheck() creates temp file with current content
4. checkSyntaxOnly() runs compiler in syntax-only mode
5. createSyntaxErrorMarkers() processes first error found
6. Eclipse marker created/updated in editor
7. Temporary files cleaned up
8. Ready for next check

‚ö° BENEFITS:

**For Users:**
- Instant feedback on syntax errors
- No need to wait for compilation
- Same visual indicators as full compilation
- Improved coding productivity
- Reduced debugging time

**For Developers:**
- Leverages existing compiler infrastructure
- Minimal code duplication
- Consistent error reporting
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Follows Eclipse plugin best practices

üõ†Ô∏è INTEGRATION POINTS:

**Editor Integration:**
- RebecaEditor.createPartControl() ‚Üí initializeRealTimeSyntaxChecker()
- RebecaEditor.dispose() ‚Üí cleanup syntax checker
- IDocumentListener interface for change detection

**Compiler Integration:**
- CompilationAndCodeGenerationProcess.retrieveCompationExtension()
- Same Spring context initialization
- Compatible with all project configurations

**Eclipse Integration:**
- IMarker.PROBLEM for error markers
- IDocumentListener for change detection
- Timer for debouncing
- Display.asyncExec() for UI thread operations

üìã TESTING SCENARIOS:

**Basic Functionality:**
1. Type syntax error ‚Üí Red X appears after 300ms
2. Fix syntax error ‚Üí Red X disappears
3. Rapid typing ‚Üí Only one check after pause
4. Multiple errors ‚Üí Only first error shown
5. Valid syntax ‚Üí No markers shown

**Edge Cases:**
1. Very large files ‚Üí Performance maintained
2. Rapid typing/deleting ‚Üí Debouncing works
3. Editor close/open ‚Üí Proper cleanup/initialization
4. Project type changes ‚Üí Configuration updates
5. Compiler errors ‚Üí Graceful fallback

**Integration Tests:**
1. Works with auto-completion
2. Works with hover tooltips
3. Works with code formatting
4. Preserves other marker types
5. Compatible with full compilation

The real-time syntax checking feature is now fully implemented and ready for use in the Rebeca IDE!
