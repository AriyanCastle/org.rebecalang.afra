ACTIVATOR.JAVA DOCUMENTATION
=============================

PURPOSE:
Eclipse plugin activator class that controls the plugin lifecycle. This is the main entry point for the Afra IDE plugin.

ECLIPSE VS AFRA:
- Eclipse framework class (extends AbstractUIPlugin)
- Afra-specific implementation for Rebeca language support

KEY METHODS:
- start(BundleContext): Initializes plugin, checks g++ compiler availability, shows error dialog if compilation backend doesn't work
- stop(BundleContext): Cleanup when plugin is stopped
- checkGPlusPlus(): Tests if g++ compiler is properly installed and working with C++11 threading support
- getImageDescriptor(String): Returns image descriptors for plugin icons

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Validates g++ compiler installation on startup
- Creates and compiles a test C++ file to verify compilation environment
- Shows error dialog if backend compilation doesn't work properly
- Essential for plugin initialization and validation
